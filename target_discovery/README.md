# Passive Target Discovery 

Recon in general Information Gathering, just collecting info about some organization or personal we can say it as recon.
Recon in general Will be described as information collection/OSINT/Discovery etc.


Two types of recon in general:

Active
------------- | 
passive 


## **Passive recon**

Gathering information without alerting the subject of the surveillance is passive reconnaissance. This is the natural start of any reconnaissance because, once alerted, a target will likely react by drastically increasing security in anticipation of an attack.



**Note: there are various of tools and ways to discover each method.**

### Methods details:


## **1- Obtains important DNS records that commonly used types:**

- A (Host address)
- AAAA (IPv6 host address)
- MX (Mail eXchange)
- PTR (Pointer)
- TXT (Descriptive text)
- SPF itâ€™s the record that specify which IP addresses and/or hostnames are authorized to send email from the specific domain and this help to discover new IP addresses.

Add your Github API key where you can find instruction from  GitHub  [here](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token) 

Then you need to add your API key in the tool file **config.py**:


```
GITHUB_TOKENS = ['**API_KEY**']
GITHUB_URL_FILE = 'rawGitUrls.txt'
GITHUB_API_URL = 'https://api.github.com/search/code?q='
GITHUB_API_COMMIT_URL = 'https://api.github.com/repos/'
GITHUB_SEARCH_PARAMS = '&sort=indexed&o=desc'
GITHUB_BASE_URL = 'https://github.com'
GITHUB_MAX_RETRY = 10
DISCORD_WEBHOOKURL = 'https://discordapp.com/api/webhooks/7XXXXXXXXXXXXXX/XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX'
SLACK_WEBHOOKURL = 'https://hooks.slack.com/services/TXXXXXXXX/BXXXXXXXX/XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX'
TELEGRAM_CONFIG = {
    "token": "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx",
    "chat_id": -999999999999999
}
```


Then save the file.
