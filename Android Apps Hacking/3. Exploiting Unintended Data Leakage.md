### How does Unintended Data Leakage work?
First, a developer’s code processes sensitive information supplied by the user or the backend. During that processing, a side-effect (that is unknown to the developer) results in that information being placed into an insecure location on the mobile device that other apps on the device may have open access to. Typically, these side-effects originate from the underlying mobile device’s operating system (OS). An attacker can simply write a small piece of code to access the location where the sensitive information is stored.

Below you can find examples of unintended data leakage in Android OS:
 
• URL Caching (Both request and response)
  
• Keyboard Press Caching
  
• Copy/Paste buffer Caching

• Application backgrounding

• Logging

• Analytics data sent to 3rd parties

#### 3.1 Information Disclosure through Logcat/Apple System Log (ASL) Logging

Android `Logs` is a great place to look for information leakage. Logging techniques are generally used by developers for debugging purposes during their application development.
In the below scenario I will explain how sensitive information could be leaked via Android logs using `adb` tool.
First step using `adb` tool we can start using `adb logcat` so we can check how the application log the data, so simply we can use the following command to save the output in a text file `adb logcat > logs.txt` as shown below:

As you can see below I will try to login to the online banking application `InsecureBankv2` with username `dinesh` and password `Dinesh@123$`.

Now we can start investigate on the logs files `logs.txt` to check if the application logging a sensitive information such as the username and password or not:
By using grep on the text file as shown below:

By using `cat logs.txt | grep "dinesh"` command I was able to find the username and password in a clear text which is Unintended Data Leakage vulnerability.
