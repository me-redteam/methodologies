### 4.1 Bypassing business logic flaws
 
Drozer is a very useful tool as it eliminates the need for having separate tools for performing different security checks in an android application. It has a list of modules that you can use to interact with the application using Android’s Inter-Process communication. Additionally, you can also install exploits and use it to exploit an android device.

First we need to install both the Drozer installer and the Agent.apk file which is the application that needs to be deployed on the device/emulator and acts as a communicator between the system and the application to be audited.
Once Drozer has been installed on your system, install the agent.apk on your device/emulator.

Then we have to set up port forwarding so that your system can connect to a TCP socket opened by the Agent inside the emulator, or on the device.

Now we can start the Agent on the mobile:

From the terminal now we connect to the device as shown below:

Use command `list` to check the Drozer modules:

We can use `app.package.list` to check the installed packages on the devices:

`Dz>run app.package.list`

To find info about a particular packages, use the module `app.package.info`. It will give out a lot of info about the application, for e.g the path where the application files are stored, the permissions that the application uses etc.
 
`dz> run app.package.info -a com.android.insecurebankv2`

Whether or not the activity can be launched by components of other applications “true” if it can be, and “false” if not. If “false”, the activity can be launched only by components of the same application or applications with the same user ID.The default value depends on whether the activity contains intent filters. The absence of any filters means that the activity can be invoked only by specifying its exact class name. This implies that the activity is intended only for application-internal use (since others would not know the class name). So in this case, the default value is “false”. On the other hand, the presence of at least one filter implies that the activity is intended for external use, so the default value is “true”.This attribute is not the only way to limit an activity’s exposure to other applications. You can also use a permission to limit the external entities that can invoke the activity (see the permission attribute).

In the Manifest file I was able to find the package name as shown below:

In the screenshot below we can see that there is an activity named .PostLogin which is set as exported.

Now we can try to call the exported activity and see if we can bypass it or now:
We can call this activity directly using the activity manager tool 

To start an activity with the am tool, here is the command.

```

adb shell

am start -n com.package.name/com.package.name.ActivityName

```

By using the activity manager tool `am start -n com.android.insecurebankv2/com.android.insecurebankv2.PostLogin` I was able to bypass the authentication and call the post login activity page.

There are a couple of ways to prevent from these kinds of vulnerabilities. First of all, the android:exported property should always be set to FALSE unless really necessary. Secondly, if the application needs to be called from some specific external applications, you can add custom permissions to the activity and only allow applications that requests that permission to call the activity.

Now we can use a very useful module app.package.attacksurface which can be used to check for exported components and whether the application is debuggable or not.

`dz> run app.package.attacksurface com.android.insecurebankv2`

Now we can try to call an exported component as we did manually before but we will do it using Drozer.

We can start so that using module `app.activity.start` to call the component or activity.

The I was able to bypass the authentication page.
