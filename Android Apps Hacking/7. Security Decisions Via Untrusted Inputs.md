### 7.1 Abusing Android Components through IPC intents ("exported" and "intent-filter")

The objective of this test is to analyze the possibility of executing activities, services from another application installed on the Android phone. 
The tool Drozer was set up to simulate a malware application installed on the phone to extract information from any mobile application. Drozer opens a TCP 31415 port on the phone to receive commands from the attacker.
In this phase, attempts were performed to check whether a malicious application will be able to execute application activities directly or not.
The following commands will initiate the attack:

In the Manifest file I was able to detect the package name as shown below:

In the screenshot below we can see that there is an activity named `.PostLogin` which is set as exported.

Now we can try to call the exported activity and see if we can bypass it or now:
We can call this activity directly using the activity manager tool 

To start an activity with the am tool, here is the command.

```
adb shell
am start -n com.package.name/com.package.name.ActivityName
```

By using the activity manager tool `am start -n com.android.insecurebankv2/com.android.insecurebankv2.PostLogin` I was able to bypass the authentication and call the post login activity page

There are a couple of ways to prevent from these kinds of vulnerabilities. First of all, the `android:exported` property should always be set to `FALSE` unless really necessary. Secondly, if the application needs to be called from some specific external applications, you can add custom permissions to the activity and only allow applications that requests that permission to call the activity.

Now we can use a very useful module `app.package.attacksurface` which can be used to check for exported components and whether the application is debuggable or not.

`dz> run app.package.attacksurface com.android.insecurebankv2`

Now we can try to call an exported component as we did manually before but we will do it using Drozer.

We can start so that using module `app.activity.start` to call the component or activity.

The I was able to bypass the authentication page.
