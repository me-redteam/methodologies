### 2. Insecure Data Storage
#### 2.1 Hacking Android Apps Using Backup Technique

I will discuss how to examine the internal memory of Android apps on non-rooted devices using the backup feature. It is possible to get the backup of a specific application package or the whole device in order to examine it. This allows us to perform an analysis on the data that is being stored on the local device at runtime.

Prerequisites:
1. USB debugging should be enabled on the device.
2. `adb` â€“ it comes along with Android SDK

Download adbextractor, which contains a set of tools required to do our job `http://sourceforge.net/projects/adbextractor/`.

I will use `adb.jar` only to perform the attack scenario.
First I will log in to the app, these information should be saved to the database

Now if the devices is not rooted, then I will not be able to access the database directory so I will use adb tool to take a back of the application.

Using `adb backup -f <filename><package name>`

I will create a new directory and move the `abe.jar` tool to the new dir, then I will take the backup from the app in the same dir with the `abe.jar`.

The above command needs user interaction as it waits for the user to click the `backup my data` button on the device.

Now I have the backup file from the target app:

I cannot directly read the contents of this file. So, I need to convert it into a format which I can understand.
This is where I'm going to use the `abe.jar` tool, which is already there in my working directory.
Using the following command `java -jar unpack backuptest1.ab backuptest1.tar`

Now I have got a new file backuptest1.tar:

After extracting this file I got a file named "apps"

Now I found a db folder that contain the application database:

Now by using a SQLlite3 client I was able to access the database file and read it shown below:
