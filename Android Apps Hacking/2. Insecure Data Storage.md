### 2. Insecure Data Storage
#### 2.1 Hacking Android Apps Using Backup Technique

I will discuss how to examine the internal memory of Android apps on non-rooted devices using the backup feature. It is possible to get the backup of a specific application package or the whole device in order to examine it. This allows us to perform an analysis on the data that is being stored on the local device at runtime.

Prerequisites:
1. USB debugging should be enabled on the device.
2. `adb` – it comes along with Android SDK

Download adbextractor, which contains a set of tools required to do our job `http://sourceforge.net/projects/adbextractor/`.

I will use `adb.jar` only to perform the attack scenario.
First I will log in to the app, these information should be saved to the database

Now if the devices is not rooted, then I will not be able to access the database directory so I will use adb tool to take a back of the application.

Using `adb backup -f <filename><package name>`

I will create a new directory and move the `abe.jar` tool to the new dir, then I will take the backup from the app in the same dir with the `abe.jar`.

The above command needs user interaction as it waits for the user to click the `backup my data` button on the device.

Now I have the backup file from the target app:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/48615614/203707209-3101137b-f294-4256-969c-0bf84ee3adc1.png)

I cannot directly read the contents of this file. So, I need to convert it into a format which I can understand.
This is where I'm going to use the `abe.jar` tool, which is already there in my working directory.
Using the following command `java -jar unpack backuptest1.ab backuptest1.tar`

Now I have got a new file backuptest1.tar:

After extracting this file I got a file named "apps"

Now I found a db folder that contain the application database:

Now by using a SQLlite3 client I was able to access the database file and read it shown below:

#### 2.2 Insecure Application Data Storage

Data can be stored persistently in various ways. The following list shows those mechanisms that are widely used on the Android platform:

	• Shared Preferences
	• Internal Storage
	• External Storage
	• SQLite Databases


	1. Shared Preferences
	Shared preferences is a common approach to store Key/Value pairs persistently in the filesystem by using an XML structure.
	`/data/data/<package-name>/shared_prefs/`
  
First we need `adb` tool to gain access to the device:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/48615614/203719664-5035957a-623c-4fe0-86bf-94ab116d3286.png)

Then we need to gain root access by using `su` command as shown below:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/48615614/203720392-8c0bbee0-822e-4438-bae6-47c1108a9643.png)

Now we can access the Shared_prefs directory using `cd /data/data/<package-name>/shared_prefs/` as shown below:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/48615614/203720528-affa040a-84f1-4d36-8ef3-31a66755861f.png)

I found interesting xml file "mySharedPreferences.xml", now we can Cat on the file to check the content:
`cat mySharedPreferences.xml`

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/48615614/203720677-c81399ef-c2b0-44ca-b5a7-f0fb6493afa7.png)

Sensitive data was found, by decryption these data I was able to retrieve username and password.


	• SQLite Database
  By accessing `cd /data/data/com.android.insecurebankv2/databases/` I was able to find a database file, after pulling the file I was able to open it using sqllite3 client

`Adb pull /data/data/com.android.insecurebankv2`

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/48615614/203723291-18f1a85c-d048-476e-976e-8401456f9c7d.png)

	3. External/internal Storage	
Check for sdcard location such as `/sdcard/`.
Access `cd /sdcard/` and check for sensitive data.

`Logact` tool can be used to check the app output during the runtime.	
`Adb logcat `command used to check the app output

By performing some Grep search I was able to detect the login process with a clear text of username and password:

#### 2.3 Hard-coded credentials

First we can decompile the application using `dex2jar`, first we need to unzip the apk file with `unzip <apk file>` as shown below:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/48615614/203744271-6d4f47bf-41d3-4b48-bc9a-07075832addf.png)

Now we can see that we have a `classes.dex` file that we need to decompile it using `dex2jar` with the following command `dex2jar classes.dex`:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/48615614/203744538-38d3ab71-152e-41eb-94d8-c791befe77df.png)

Now we can open the Jar file using jd-gui and start looking for sensitive data, hard-coded data:

After performing some analysis on the classes, I was able to find if statement with hard coded username which could be used to login without password:

It was possible for me to login using the hard-coded username "devadmin" without any password:
