### 8.1 Reverse Engineering the Application Code

Reverse engineering is the process of understanding how things work and reusing the information to do something. This is applicable even to Android apps. You might reverse engineer Android apps for many reasons.

  1. Read anotherâ€™s code
  2. Find vulnerabilities in the code
  3. Search for sensitive data hardcoded in the code
  4. Malware Analysis
  5. Modifying the functionality of an existing application

#### Disassembling Android Apps
It is possible to get the SMALI version of code using the well-known tool `apktool` using the following command `apktool d <package name>`:

Now we have the SMALI files:

#### Decompiling Android Apps
	
First we can decompile the application using `dex2jar`, first we need to unzip the apk file with `unzip <apk file>` as shown below:

Now we can see that we have a classes.dex file that we need to decompile it using `dex2jar` with the following command `dex2jar classes.dex`:

Now we can open the Jar file using jd-gui and start looking for sensitive data, hard-coded data:

After performing some analysis on the classes, I was able to find if statement with hard coded username which could be used to login without password:

It was possible for me to login using the hard-coded username "devadmin" without any password:

### 8.2 Unauthorized Code Modification

Below I will explain how I could modify the application code by decompile the apk and recompile it.

First of all we need to Disassembling the apk file using the apktool to SMALI files.

To get the SMALI version of code using the well-known tool `APKTOOL` using the following command `apktool d <package name>`:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/48615614/204355232-be7e6520-6da9-4add-8cf1-351c792b48e2.png)

Now we have the SMALI files:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/48615614/204355272-8baa741b-e5df-4cd6-99f7-837c42e17b97.png)

Then open the smali file with a text editor that we need to make a change with, and by making a small change as shown below then we can save the file again:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/48615614/204355322-dd78c8a0-189b-42d8-8c5f-03caf8f4658f.png)

Now we should recompile the application again after the new change, In order to re-compile the application, we can simply use the following command:

`apktool b <package folder path>`

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/48615614/204355521-dc6d6d0a-5c49-4290-866f-5b45e0de9f4b.png)

A new apk file will be generated under `/dist/` folder:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/48615614/204355675-1229afb9-4fdf-4081-9e94-e93ab6fc4d14.png)

Now we need to sign the new apk so we can install it on the devices, I will use a tool `apksign` using the below commands:
https://github.com/appium/sign

Now we need to install the new apk using the `adb` tool:

Now we can see that the application is running smoothly after the changes.
