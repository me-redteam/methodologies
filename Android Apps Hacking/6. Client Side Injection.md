### 6.1 Insufficient WebView hardening (XSS)

In web applications, JavaScript can be injected in many ways by leveraging reflected, stored or DOM based Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). Mobile apps are executed in a sandboxed environment and when implemented natively do not possess this attack vector. Nevertheless, WebViews can be part of a native app to allow viewing of web pages. Every app has its own cache for WebViews and doesn't share it with the native Browser or other apps. WebViews in Android are using the WebKit rendering engine to display web pages but are stripped down to a minimum of functions, as for example no address bar is available. If the WebView is implemented too lax and allows the usage of JavaScript it can be used to attack the app and gain access to its data.

#### Static Analysis

The source code need to be checked for usage and implementations of the WebView class. To create and use a WebView, an instance of the class WebView need to be created.

```
WebView webview = new WebView(this);
setContentView(webview);
webview.loadUrl("https://www.owasp.org/");
```

Different settings can be applied to the WebView of which one is to activate and deactivate JavaScript. By default JavaScript is disabled in a WebView, so it need to be explicitly enabled. Look for the method setJavaScriptEnabled to check if JavaScript is activated.
	
  ```webview.getSettings().setJavaScriptEnabled(true);```

This allows the WebView to interpret JavaScript and execute its command.

#### Dynamic Analysis

A Dynamic Analysis depends on different surrounding conditions, as there are different possibilities to inject JavaScript into a WebView of an app:

	• Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in an endpoint, where the exploit will be sent to the WebView of the mobile app when navigating to the vulnerable function.
	• Man-in-the-middle (MITM) position by an attacker where he is able to tamper the response by injecting JavaScript.
	• Malware tampering local files that are loaded by the WebView.

In order to address these attack vectors, the outcome of the following checks should be verified:

	• All functions offered by the endpoint need to be free of stored XSS.
	• The HTTPS communication need to be implemented according to best practices to avoid MITM attacks. This means:
		○ whole communication is encrypted via TLS (see test case "Testing for Unencrypted Sensitive Data on the Network"),
		○ the certificate is checked properly (see test case "Testing Endpoint Identify Verification") and/or
		○ the certificate is even pinned (see "Testing Custom Certificate Stores and SSL Pinning")
	• Only files within the app data directory should be rendered in a WebView (see test case "Testing for Local File Inclusion in WebViews").

In the below scenario instead of inserting the account number, I was able to inject a JavaScript Code as shown below:

The screenshot below shows that every time I try to view the statements, a popup alert occurring which is a Stored XSS:

we can use the metasploit module below that will run a web server instance. Once the mobile application accesses the crafted URL. A meterpreter session will be created. 
`exploit/android/browser/webview_addjavascriptinterface`

The  screenshot shows that I was not able to exploit a Webview:

### 6.2 Content Providers: SQL Injection and Local File Inclusion

Content providers could be vulnerable to SQL injection vulnerability and could leak a sensitive data.

Tesing the content provider for SQL injection vulnerability `scanner.provider.injection -a package_name` as shown below:
