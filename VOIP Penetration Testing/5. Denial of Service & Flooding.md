### Denial of Service / Flooding

A denial of service attack on VoIP services can render it useless by causing an intentionally damage to the network and VoIP systems availability. This attack can occur on two levels, standard network dos attacks and VoIP specific dos attacks. Generally we will send tons of data by flooding the network to consume all its resources or a specific protocol in order to overwhelm it with tons of requests. Letâ€™s take a quick overview of the tools available in Kali.

#### inviteflood
This tool can be used to flood a target with `INVITE` requests it can be used to target sip gateways/proxies and sip phones.

As long the tool keeps flooding the sip gateway it will prevent users from making phone calls. You can flood the sip proxy with an inexistent extension thus making it generating a 404 not found just to keep it busy.

#### Rtpflood
Rtp flood is used to flood a target IP phone with a UDP packet contains a RTP data In order to launch a successful attack using rtpflood you will need know the RTP listening port on the remote device you want to attack, for example; x-lite sofphone default rtp port is 8000.

First you will need to capture a valid sip OK response and use its from and to tags and a valid caller id value.
