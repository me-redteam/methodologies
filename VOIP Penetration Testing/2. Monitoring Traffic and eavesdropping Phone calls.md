### Monitoring Traffic and eavesdropping Phone calls

Monitoring VoIP traffic can allow an attacker capture SIP requests and RTP data sent from clients to server and back. It can serve two attack vectors:

	• Capturing SIP authentication.
	• Eavesdropping users phone calls.
  
For demonstration purposes we will use the following scenario:

For this attack vector we will need to perform a Man in The Middle Attack which will require the following steps:

	• Arp poisoning/spoofing
	• Sniffing traffic
  
Decoding RTP data to an audio file.

#### Arp Poisoning using Arpspoof
Before we can begin to sniff traffic we will need to arp poison our switch/gateway, we’ll be using a tool called `Arpspoof`,we will need to enable IP forwarding:

Arpspoof syntax should look as follows:

For a successful MITM attack we will need to spoof both ways:

We will let our Arp poisoning run in the background while performing a capture using Wireshark. 

#### Capturing traffic and Eavesdropping using Wireshark

Now let’s fire up Wireshark to capture some traffic. We will use the following Wireshark capture filter:

Now let’s start capturing some traffic… While sniffing for traffic User “B” has launched the X-Lite soft phone on his desktop computer and dialed to user “A” extension 200. 

Wireshark has captured some traffic, after a while I have stopped the capture process and saved the sessions into a file called “sip.pcap”.

We can see that we have captured the SIP traffic but for this section we are more interested in the RTP traffic because it contains the actual conversation data.

Wireshark has a pretty cool feature to decode captured VoIP calls data into playable audio format You can find this feature under the Statistics -> VoIP Calls menu.

#### VoIPong
VoIPong is a utility which detects all Voice over IP calls on a pipeline, and for those which are G711 encoded, dumps actual conversation to separate wave files. It supports SIP, H323, Cisco's Skinny Client Protocol, RTP and RTCP. VoIPong is located in Backtrack “/pentest/voip/voipong” directory Before we can use VoIPong we will need to make some changes to the voipong.conf file: 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/48615614/204588045-3d356cc8-f104-4399-8823-6a4b13888cc5.png)

Now we can start VoIPong to capture some VoIP conversations 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/48615614/204588131-57aa7f55-0355-4095-b075-d7cb3098b835.png)

Once VoIPong detects a phone call it will start capture it once it finish VoIPong will stop the capture process and will render it to a playable wave file. All conversation will be saved into the `/pentest/voip/voipong/output` folder.

#### Capturing SIP Authentication using SIPDump

SIPDump is a part of the SIPCrack tools suite, it allows performing a live capture of SIP authentication digest response or it can dump a previously captured sessions from a PCAP file. SIPDump Usage:

SIPDump will write the authentication challenge response to the specified file which looks as follows:
