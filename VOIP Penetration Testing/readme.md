### VOIP Penetration testing

Cyber-attacks pose numerous threats to VoIP telephone systems, such as the capture of inbound and outbound calls through network manipulation, recording or listening in on calls, gaining access to internal networks through the voice VLANS and use of the network to make outbound calls (toll fraud).

In order to facilitate correct operation of VoIP devices, VoIP systems often operate outside of normal network security controls. We are able to assist you in securing your VoIP systems.

We will assess your network infrastructure, VoIP components and authentication methods, and their capability to prevent manipulation between your clients and VoIP server to determine the scope of your security, providing a detailed report and recommendations for remediating issues and vulnerabilities.

Our testing generally includes investigating the authentication mechanisms, as well as the potential interception, interruption or manipulation of the exchanged information between the client and VoIP server.

What are we looking to do when conducting a VoIP Penetration Test? The goals are not dissimilar to that of a traditional network penetration test:

	• Information Gathering, Footprinting and Enumeration.
	• Monitoring Traffic and eavesdropping Phone calls.
	• Attacking Authentication.
	• VLAN Hopping.
	• Denial of Service / Flooding.
	• Spoofing Caller ID.

In order to achieve these goals, a VoIP-focused methodology is extremely helpful so that these types of assessments can be both repeatable and consistent over the course of time. The methodology is similar to that of a traditional penetration test:

#### Phase 1: Gather Information

What types of phones are in use? Who makes them? Model? Where is the SIP Server? What’s the software in use? Are they using TCP or UDP for traffic? Are they sending it through secure means? What are their IPs and what other ports are open on these devices? These are all questions that need to be answered during the initial phase of the penetration test.

#### Phase 2: Enumeration

concentrate on finding extensions and usernames/passwords for users across the VoIP network. The main focus of this phase is to find your way(s) in. Utilizing who and how someone uses the VoIP is key when trying to get in.

#### Phase 3: Exploit

This is the phase where the magic happens. In this phase, the aforementioned goals are tested. One tries to grab whatever information they can from calls in progress, send requests, and test the entire VoIP network through traditional means by logging into web management portals, network segmentation, VLAN hopping and so on.
