#### SIP Basics

The SIP (Session Initiation Protocol) role is to setup, terminate or modify a voice or a video call where the voice and/or video traffic are being carried by a protocol like RTP (Real time transport Protocol). SIP is an application layer protocol which uses UDP for transport (TCP and SCTP can be used as well).
SIP usually uses ports 5060 TCP or UDP for unencrypted signaling or 5061 for encrypted transportation using TLS.

SIP is an ASCII based protocol which has some similar elements like in the HTTP protocol by using a Request/Response model. Much like an HTTP request from a browser a SIP client request is made using a SIP URI a user agent and a method/request. SIP uses e-mail like addresses format: `user/phone@domain/ip` A typical SIP URI looks like:

`sip:205@192.168.1.100`, `sip:username@pbx.com`, `sip:205@192.168.1.100:5060`

According to the request made by the client a response will be received with a status or error code, the following tables describe the available requests and responses in the SIP protocol.

#### SIP Requests / Methods

#### SIP Responses

#### SIP Call Between 2 Phones Example

	  • The calling phone sends an invite.
	  • The called phone sends back a response of 100 (Trying).
	  • The called phone then starts to ring and sends a response of 180 (Ringing).
	  • When the caller picks up the phone the called phone sends a response of 200 (OK).
	  • The calling phone sends an ACK response.
	  • Conversation begins via RTP.
	  • When the caller hangs up the phone a BYE request is sent.
    • The calling phone responds with 200 (OK).


#### Attack Vectors

	  • Information Gathering, Footprinting and Enumeration.
	  • Monitoring Traffic and eavesdropping Phone calls.
	  • Attacking Authentication.
	  • VLAN Hopping.
	  • Denial of Service / Flooding.
    • Spoofing Caller ID.


### Information Gathering

This phase is where we gather information about the topology, servers and clients to learn as much information as we can in order to launch a successful attack. What we are interested in finding is live hosts, PBX type and version, VoIP servers/gateways, clients (hardware and software) types and versions etc… Instead of enumerating “usernames” we will be enumerating SIP extensions. 


#### SVMAP
SVMAP is a part of a suite of tools called SIPVicious and it’s my favorite scanner of choice It can be used to scan identify and fingerprint a single IP or a range of IP addresses. Svmap allows specifying the request method which is being used for scanning, the default method is OPTIONS, it offers debug and verbosity options and even allows scanning the SRV records for SIP on the destination domain. You can use the `./svmap –h` in order to view all the available arguments.


`svmap – Lists` SIP devices found on an IP range

Scanning an IP range:

It should be noted that the default used method in svmap is OPTIONS, methods could be changed with (-m) option. Avoid using "INVITE" methods as it will invoke ringing the destination target

It should be noted also, the tested softphone (LinPhone) supports `INVITE`, `NOTIFY`, `SUBSCRIBE`, `OPTIONS`, `CANCEL`, `MESSAGE`, `INFO` methods. Any other methods (i.e `REGISTER`) in the request will respond with a status-code of : `501 Not implemented`.


The drawback of this tool, that it uses unmodified fields in its SIP requests (as shown below) an already has IPS/IDS signatures that easily detect its scanning behavior. Thus there is a patched python script of it.

#### Fingerprinting scanning

#### Scanning SIP Enabled Devices
Metasploit provides a sip scanner auxiliary which comes in two flavors TCP and UDP, we can use it to discover SIP enabled devices using the OPTION method: Let’s see an example of the UDP version: `auxiliary/scanner/sip/options` Auxiliary Options and Usage:

#### Enumerating SIP extensions / Usernames
The `auxiliary/scanner/sip/enumerator`  can be used to discover valid SIP accounts, it supports two methods of discovery: OPTIONS and REGISTER, it also comes in two flavors TCP and UDP. Auxiliary options:

#### Extensions Enumeration
Extension enumeration can aid an attacker by finding valid extensions on a VoIP system which later can lead to a brute force attack on the SIP accounts. Extension enumeration works by examining errors returned by a sip requests methods like `REGISTER`, `OPTIONS` and `INVITE`. 

#### Svwar
Svwar is also a tool from the sipvicious suite allows to enumerate extensions by using a range of extensions or using a dictionary file svwar supports all the of the three extension enumeration methods as mentioned above, the default method for enumeration is `REGISTER`.

You can specify another sip method by using the `-m` argument, you can also add `t` `-v` or `-vv` for verbosity.

#### Enumiax
Enumiax is used to enumerate Asterisk Exchange protocol usernames. It allows for a dictionary attack or a sequential Username Guessing:

We can also use Enumeration module in `Viproy` framework:

#### SIPSAK
SIPSAK is used for testing SIP enabled applications and devices using the OPTION request method only. We can use it to fingerprint and enumeration.

Here is an example for using sipsak to fingerprint a sip enabled device We can see in the result that the device we queried is an Audiocodes MP-114 FXS gateway.
