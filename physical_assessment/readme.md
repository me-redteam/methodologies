RedTeam Security's Physical Penetration Testing Methodology
RedTeam's physical penetration testing methodology is comprised of several phases.  Each penetration test is conducted consistently using globally accepted and industry-standard frameworks. At a minimum, the RedTeam's physical penetration tests underlying framework is based on the NIST Special Publication 800 Series guidance and OSSTMM.

RedTeam's expert pentesters will carefully examine both your physical surroundings and internal environment to identify potential security vulnerabilities. We'll also spot any potential weaknesses that may exist in your established security controls so you can employ additional countermeasures.



Physical Penetration Testing Steps:

The steps of a penetration test performed by RedTeam Security on your physical location are pretty straightforward. We take a meticulous approach to ensure nothing is overlooked. Every security detail is accounted for - you can be certain attackers will be exploring everything from your locks to peeping in your windows. They're not above dumpster diving for information that can help them achieve their malicious goals. We get into an attacker's mindset as we cover all angles throughout our penetration testing phases using the following steps in our methodology.



Information Gathering/OSINT

As with other types of penetration testing, the first phase in a physical penetration test is to focus on gathering as much information as possible about the target locations. This Is one of the most critical steps in our pen testing processes because it helps us to examine your organization from the perspective of a "bad guy" and enables us to see everything an attacker would be by utilizing public tools, such as Google Earth, social media, and job boards. Using this approach, it is usually possible to learn a great deal about the target's (in this case, your facility's) surroundings and environment.

Once we've gathered knowledge and intel about your facility, we turn our eye to a step we call Open Source Intelligence (OSINT). Open Source Intelligence gathering can be quite telling about a target, its people, and specifics about the physical environment. To accomplish this step, we utilize a different set of public tools, including social networks and job boards, to name just two.

The depth of this phase will vary based on the specific engagement. In some cases, the client will provide much of the information needed to create the RedTeam Operations Plan (i.e., vendors used, photographs of the locations, floorplans, front desk procedures, dress codes, a photo of badge, security systems in place).



Active Reconnaissance/Covert Observation:

The Active Reconnaissance phase of physical penetration testing involves gathering information that can be found offline. Depending on the engagement, RedTeam may engage in social engineering activities to obtain information not publicly found or learn details that are impossible to find online.

This phase will also involve Covert Observation, visiting each location, and taking photos that help to document where we can bypass existing barriers or gain access to unsecured ones. We will also observe dress codes, identify where the staff takes breaks, any doors that may be left open, physical security controls like security cameras and equipment, security guard behavior, and front desk procedures. Access badges may also be cloned. This information will be used to establish the plan of attack.



Attack Planning & Pretexting:

Intelligence gathered through the previous steps is combined into a Red Team Operations Plan (RTOP). The RTOP includes creating a Pretext (the story being used if social engineering techniques are being leveraged), the targets and goals, estimated timings for execution, key information learned about the locations, and the equipment that may be needed. Once the plan is approved, equipment will be prepared, and the "get out of jail" letter will be printed in preparation for execution.



Actions on Objective/Exploitation & Post-Exploitation:

This is where the team executes the attack that was outlined in the RedTeam Operations Plan (RTOP). This may include leveraging a copied access card, tailgating into a location, bypassing door locks and security alarms, leveraging social engineering practices or other agreed-upon methods to accomplish the goal in each location. Different actions may be taken at the same location at different times of the day. Once RedTeam Security gains access to a location, the agreed-upon post-exploitation activities are executed, and evidence is gathered.



Reporting:

By combining the results of the information gathering, OSINT, attack planning/pretexting, and execution into a comprehensive report that includes a summary of the steps taken, evidence, observations, and recommendations, a plan can be developed from this report to reduce any risks going forward.



How To Prepare For Your Physical Penetration Test:

A physical penetration test sets out to uncover weaknesses in your physical security before bad actors are able to discover and exploit them. This type of testing, also known as physical intrusion testing, attempts to compromise perimeter security, intrusion alarms, motion detectors, locks, sensors, cameras, mantraps and other physical barriers to gain unauthorized physical access to sensitive areas.

Physical penetration testing is typically motivated by one of three things:

Recognition that physical security is an attack factor that cannot be ignored.
Desire to get buy-in from decision-makers with a better idea of any unknowns.
Compliance requirements.


A thorough physical penetration test has many stages:

Passive Reconnaissance — information gathering about the target's surroundings and environment, perhaps using a tool such as Google Earth.
Open Source Intelligence — taking advantage of freely available information about the target as well as its people and specifics about the environment.
Active Reconnaissance — obtaining information through telephoning, emailing or otherwise directly querying target staff or vendors.
Covert Observation — stakeouts, drones, and covert photography help identify physical security controls and monitor staff as they are coming and going.
Attack Planning — using what's been learned about vulnerabilities, exit and entrance points, cameras, guards, fences, company technology, staff members, and more.
Pretexting — ensuring the testing equipment, transportation and personnel are ready to roll.
Infiltration, Exploitation — carrying out the planned attack.
Post-Exploitation — penetrating further into the environment and setting up to maintain a persistent backdoor.
You can have the sturdiest firewall and most up-to-date password policies and rigorous user permissions, but if someone can gain direct access to your buildings, these other precautions may be little help. A bad actor exploiting your physical security can lead to device theft or provide access to unsecured desktop computers, internal networks, writing closets, data centers and satellite facilities and branches.



To prepare for the testing, you'll want to first understand your assets. What is it that those with malicious intent might seek to access? This could be different in a medical office setting (where the goal might be to gather personal identifying information?) than in at a substation (at which the objective might instead be to disrupt power flow)
Next, use the assets identified in item #1 to identify parameters and priorities. Now that you understand what can be involved in penetration testing, take the time to identify your objectives. What do you want to verify or evaluate? Also, who is going to be aware of the testing? You want only a few of the right people to know about the physical penetration testing in advance, so as not to tip the testers hand too early.
Consider your threat-actors. This might be a malicious insider, an angry ex-employee, an organized crime unit, an opportunist jumping on a crime of opportunity, nation states, the list goes on. Forming the plan for the engagement while also considering the threat actor is a good idea (in addition to considering your assets as outlined above).
Also, make sure that you have determined who is going to be the company's point of contact during the execution of the testing. This individual should have the knowledge base to compare the testers' actions against the company employee's reactions and response times. Empower this person to address any gaping security flaws that should be urgently remediated (or at least directly communicate with those who can address the concern).


RedTeam Security teams know precisely how criminals might gain access to both computer systems and buildings. A security consultant may rely upon any or all these methods to gain access to the specified locations during a physical penetration test and to identify damage that could be done once that access is gained.  An ADGovCERT will take photos of:



Bypass Doors - If the building uses an electronic key or combination lock, RedTeam Security may clone a badge, leverage widely available master keys, or may use special tools on improperly hung doors to gain access.  If doors or windows are left propped open or are unlocked, those may be leveraged as an easy method to gain access.
Bypass Physical Barriers - If a location has fencing, gates, or other physical barriers, RedTeam Security may climb the fence, leverage gaps in the fencing, or bypass gate controls using publicly available techniques.  
Identify Ways to Steal Information - Once RedTeam Security has gained access to a location, the penetration tester will observe ways to obtain confidential or sensitive information.  This could include identifying unattended computers with active sessions, abandoned access cards, computer screens with confidential data facing common areas, or sensitive information in the trash.

Note:  RedTeam Security does not remove equipment; they will take a photo as evidence of damage that could be done.  
Network Jacks in Public Areas - The security engineer may attempt to connect to the company network by connecting their device through network jacks in community areas (i.e., conference rooms, break rooms) to identify opportunities to harm.
Gain Access to Sensitive Areas - The RedTeam Security physical security expert may attempt to gain access to sensitive areas of a building, including server rooms, executive offices, or other identified locations.  If a bad actor gained access to this room, they could easily disable the machines. They might also use unattended peripherals to steal data or introduce a virus.
Check the Trash - The penetration tester may look into the types of materials that employees discard and whether the company has a shredding policy and available shredders. If this kind of information makes it to a dumpster, criminals will find it easy to steal.
Social Engineering - Social engineering techniques could be leveraged to gain access to a location by tailgating or leveraging a pretext to mislead employees and convince them to allow access to the building or sensitive information or locations within the building.
